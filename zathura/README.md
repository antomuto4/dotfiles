# Zathura

### Installation of Zathura

`sudo pacman -S zathura zathura-pdf-poppler appmenu-gtk-module`

### Moving the rc file

- move the zathurarc file to `~/.config/zathura/zathurarc` and you're ready to roll. The `bash.rc` already has an alias simply called 'pdf' so all you need to do to launch up a PDF file is: `pdf ~/.pdf/file-to-pdf.pdf` and that's about it.
