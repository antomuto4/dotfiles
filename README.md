# personal dotfiles
- These are my dotfiles, and other stuff that probably doesn't fucking matter.

### Please note that every file in this directory is a dotfile

- If you are planning to use this, everything that's in this main directory should be renamed so that the `.` comes before the actual name. For example: from `bashrc` to `.bashrc`
