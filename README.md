# personal dotfiles
- These are my dotfiles, and other stuff that probably doesn't fucking matter.

### Please note that there are some files in this directory is are dotfiles

- If you are planning to use this, some files in this main directory should be renamed so that the `.` comes before the actual name. For example: from `bashrc` to `.bashrc`

- Here is a list of what exactly has to be renamed:

- `bashrc`, `xprofile`

- Folders: `config`, `doom.d`, `emacs.d`
